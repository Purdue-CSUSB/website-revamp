# website-revamp

Repository for all files relating to the Website Revamp project (2023)

To start:

- open up 2 terminal tabs
  cd into server for one of them
  npm install in both terminal tabs (there might also be others to npm install)
  type "npm start" and "node server.js" in server to start up the react app

For running the server:

Make sure to create your own .env file in the server folder -- add the file I sent in slack (if you can't find it, feel free to message me!) Also create a .gitignore file in the server folder, and add ".env" to it. With this, you should be good!

Let me know if you run into any issues! If it runs and it's just broken I might just be working on something and haven't patched a bug yet

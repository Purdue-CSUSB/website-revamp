Depending on your preference, there is something for everyone in CS research' },
    { title: 'What are the different types of research I can be involved in?', content: 'At Purdue, there are a vast amount of openings for all different openings.

Almost any type of research is available at Purdue.' },
    { title: 'Do I need a lot of experience to join a project?', content: 'Depending on the project, experience level may matter.

Talk to your advisor more about whether credits from research can be applied towards your graduation. As well, you can get paid for some research projects. Make sure to read the description of the projects to see if they will pay you.' }

# website-revamp
Repository for all files relating to the Website Revamp project (2023)

To start:
- open up 2 terminal tabs
    cd into server for one of them, cd into src for the other
    npm install react in src, and npm install mongoose and node in server (there might also be others to npm install)
    type "npm start" in src and "node server.js" in server to start up the react app

Let me know if you run into any issues! If it runs and it's just broken I might just be working on something and haven't patched a bug yet
